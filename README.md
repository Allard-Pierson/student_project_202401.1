# AAI Project Bibliotheek

## Description
The assignment given to us by the University Library of Amsterdam is to interpret a search query and connect it to a classification system that is used by the library. The goal is to translate a search query into a relevant topic.


## Getting started

Python version 3.8.5 || 3.11.5

### api

To make sure you have the correct libraries installed run:
```pip install -r api/requirements.txt```

### frontend

In the project directory (./webpage/uva_webpage/), you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
